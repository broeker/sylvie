Hello! 
My name is Sylvie Broeker, I am a designer based in Minneapolis. As a designer, my creative practice lies at the intersection of art and design. I value the fluidity between these disciplines and the opportunities for innovation that arise from their convergence. 
A hands-on, continuous approach is central to my process, even when the outcomes are not immediately clear. I embrace the process of exploration and recognize that working with found objects and unconventional materials can lead to truly unique and transformative outcomes. This essence of experimentation is what drives me to continually push boundaries and evolve my practice.
Thanks for checking out my work, don't hesitate to reach out with any thoughts or inquires!
